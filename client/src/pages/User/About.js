        <h1>History Of The Brand</h1>
        <p>
          Men's fashion was founded in 1989 and was acquired by Indi in 1999. It
          now has over 790 stores in more than 75 markets.
        </p>

        <p>
          The brand was originally aimed at men's fashion. Starting in 1995,
          women's fashion was launched in all its dimensions: from the most
          urban lines to the more casual. With this, Men's fashion has
          consolidated at all levels as a group with national and international
          growth, which today has over 10,000 employees.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2003, Men's fashion launched a children's fashion range under the
          trade name Boys & Girls fashion. This line is being implemented
          progressively in stores in several markets, where the stores are large
          enough to house its specific space.
